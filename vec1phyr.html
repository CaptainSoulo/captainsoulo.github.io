							<p>
							vec1phyr is a tech enthusiast with over 15 years worth of self-taught and certified experience. He started off with small-time
							hacking on Windows such as modding video games, creating gaming servers for his friends. As he progressed in his studies, he became
							fascinated by achieving root access on his devices. Most of his devices are jailbroken/rooted in some sort of way, he would then use
							said devices as a developing playground, UI/UX customization on all video game consoles and end-user devices. Now, his primary focus is 
							UNIX operating systems such as macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. He also works with Windows but not as often as the operating systems mentioned.
							During his learning experiences, he launched "TheDeadlyApple" to host his tweaks, themes and scripts for his friends and other iOS users to try
							for themselves. While unpopular, it's often maintained, updated and advertised to keep up with current jailbreaking news. The site originally
							started off as a jailbreaking blog with access to many downloads of all sorts of goodies, vec1phyr quietly removed them due to the lack of
							views and downloads. TheDeadlyApple is //obviously// up and maintained to this day. He is also known as the system-administrator
							for DuckSquadNetwork Gaming Servers owned by TheHeroBilly, as the primary maintainer to provide maximum security and performance on all servers.
							TheDeadlyApple and DuckSquadNetwork have ever since been direct affiliates as partnering websites, providing a wonderful tech experience.</p>
							<p>
							<br>
							<br>
							As an underground homebrew developer, he's mostly known in the iOS community as a graphic designer of sorts, from larger projects such as device-wide 
							themes to carrier logo replacements. His reputation isn't very much in the community itself, he plans to build on that reputation as much as he 
							can whether it's in iOS or another platform of sorts. His graphic designing abilities are followed by the years of experience with technology. Currently,
							he is progressing on multiple platforms to learn their coding languages so he may develop better and more complex tweaks and softwares.</p>
							<p>
							<br>
							<br>
							While he quietly works on graphics, tech, programming and other forms of technology manipulation, he also takes care of his wonderful family of one son
							and his wife. He never refers to either of them by their true names but jokes around by calling them "vec1fam" around internet friends to
							protect their identity. You'll also find them wearing Guy Fawkes masks alongside him to conceal their faces in pictures. He also works for himself as a
							computer/smartdevice repairman for some side-money until he becomes entirely certified as an IT technician.</p>
